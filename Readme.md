## Profile:

I have studied mining engineering at METU and worked as a mining engineer for 1.5 years where I have written a simple ERP program that was used to control the shifts. Left the job for military service and later, I have started working at a cement factory. Seeing how hard it is for humans to work in heavy industries I have started to think about finding ways to replace humans with robots. This intention took me to Udacity where I have learned cores of Deep learning and Self-driving cars. As I studied online I have started looking for more conventional education and started robotics and materials master at SIGMA Clermont, France where had a chance to see all kind of robots in action (Kuka, Baxter, Franka-Emika Panda, parallel robots, serial robots...). Had my master's degree in September 2019 and now I am looking for an opportunity where I can keep my hard work on.
